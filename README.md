# RSVP-Movies-analysis-SQL
Analysing dataset of RSVP movies, a production company, to help them plan their future project for maximum profits, using SQL.

## Problem Statement:

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. I have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. I have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

I am a data analyst and an SQL expert, and have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights.

## Insights given to management:

1. The movie RSVP movies make next should preferably be from the genres Drama, Thriller or Comedy since these are the most popular genres with the audience, and they have most number of movies made.

2. If the movie is in Drama genre, the duration of movie should be around 110 minutes, for Thriller and Comedy genres it should be around 100 minutes.

3. The movie should be multilingual since they have a wider reach, but even in multilingual it should definitely have Hindi as one of the languages.

4. It should be with the production house Marvel Studios, Star Cinema, or Twentieth Century Fox since these are the production houses with maximum number of votes and experience with multilingual films.

5. Movie should have James Mangold as director, and it should star Vijay Sethupathi as lead actor and Taapsee Pannu as lead actress.

6. Movie should be released in the month of March.
